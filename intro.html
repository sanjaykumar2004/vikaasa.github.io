                This about page was designed by<b> S. Sanjay kumar</b> of 10th B.
                The page was dedicated to the science exhibition of <i>vikaasa school </i>in 2020. 
                  <br><br>
                There were many hardship faced by me to make this page, It was done by my
                own effort without others help.
                <br>
                <br>
                The pages done by us are
                <br>
                Web pages: - <i>  Sanjay kumar</i>
                <br>
                Supported by:- <i>Jonathan</i>
                <br>

                We have started learning how to design by watching youtube and referring notes from other websites.
                it nearly took more than 3 weeks to learn html and css. at the last week we started to design the page,
                and launched out our page. It nearly took 5 days to build  this page
                we really don't have time to present this page more good, so we rushed upon,
                that's what we could do. Also i am glad to say that this was my <i><b>first website</b></i> made.
                <br><br>
                Note:- This video's from youtube are brought to our science page using link.
                According to 'fair use purpose' this video are brought into the page for only
                for our science exhibition. We are not using the video's commercially. Also this
                page will be presented on the web only until the exhibition.
